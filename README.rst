A Python (and optimised C++) implementation of **anonymous linkage** using
*cryptographic linkage keys* as described by Rainer Schnell, Tobias
Bachteler, and JÃ¶rg Reiher in `A Novel Error-Tolerant Anonymous Linking
Code <http://www.record-linkage.de/-download=wp-grlc-2011-02.pdf>`__.

Computes similarity scores, and/or best guess matches between two sets
of *cryptographic linkage keys* (hashed entity records).

Use `clkhash <https://github.com/n1analytics/clkhash>`__ to create cryptographic linkage keys
from personally identifiable data.

The tables are interpreted as follows. The first section compares the
bandwidth doing popcounts through (i) the Python bitarray library and
(ii) a native code implementation in assembler.  The latter
implementation is measured in two ways: the first measures just the
time taken to compute the popcounts, while the second includes the
time taken to copy the data out of the running Python instance as well
as copying the result back into Python. The "% copying" measure is the
proportion of time spent doing this copying.

The second section includes two tables that measure the throughput of
the Dice coefficient comparison function. The two tables correspond to
two different choices of "matching threshold", 0.5 and 0.7, which were
chosen to characterise two different performance scenarios. Since the
data used for comparisons is randomly generated, the first threshold
value will cause about 50% of the candidates to "match", while the
second threshold value will cause <0.01% of the candidates to match
(these values are reported in the "match %" column).  In both cases,
all matches above the threshold are returned and passed to the
solver. In the first case, the large number of matches means that much
of the time is spent keeping the candidates in order so that the top
`k` matches can be returned. In the latter case, the tiny number of
candidate matches means that the throughput is determined primarily by
the comparison code itself.

Finally, the Total Time column includes indications as to the
proportion of time spent calculating the (sparse) similarity matrix
`comparisons` and the proportion of time spent `matching` in the
greedy solver. This latter is determined by the size of the similarity
matrix, which will be approximately `#comparisons * match% / 100`.

Tests
=====

Run unit tests with `pytest`:

::

    $ pytest
    ====================================== test session starts ======================================
    platform linux -- Python 3.6.4, pytest-3.2.5, py-1.4.34, pluggy-0.4.0

    ======================== 65 passed, 2 skipped, 4 xfailed in 4.01 seconds ========================

To enable slightly larger tests add the following environment variables:

-  INCLUDE_10K
-  INCLUDE_100K

Limitations
-----------

-  The linkage process has order n^2 time complexity - although algorithms exist to
   significantly speed this up. Several possible speedups are described
   in http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/P4Join-BTW2015.pdf
