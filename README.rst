A Python (and optimised C++) implementation of **anonymous linkage** using
*cryptographic linkage keys* as described by Rainer Schnell, Tobias
Bachteler, and JÃ¶rg Reiher in `A Novel Error-Tolerant Anonymous Linking
Code <http://www.record-linkage.de/-download=wp-grlc-2011-02.pdf>`__.

Computes similarity scores, and/or best guess matches between two sets
of *cryptographic linkage keys* (hashed entity records).

Use `clkhash <https://github.com/n1analytics/clkhash>`__ to create cryptographic linkage keys
from personally identifiable data.

Installation
============

Install directly from PyPi:

::

    pip install anonlink

Or to install from source:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

Alternative - Manually compile the C++ library
----------------------------------------------

For mac with:

::

    g++ -std=c++11 -mssse3 -mpopcnt -O2 -Wall -pedantic -Wextra -dynamiclib -fpic -o _entitymatcher.dll dice_one_against_many.cpp

For linux with:

::

    g++ -std=c++11 -mssse3 -mpopcnt -O2 -Wall -pedantic -Wextra -shared -fpic -o _entitymatcher.so dice_one_against_many.cpp

C++ version uses cpu instruction ``POPCNT`` for bitcount in a 64bit
word. http://wm.ite.pl/articles/sse-popcount.html

Tests
=====

Run unit tests with nose

::

    $ python -m nose
    ......................SS..............................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 54 tests in 6.615s

    OK (SKIP=2)

To enable slightly larger tests add the following environment variables:

-  INCLUDE_10K
-  INCLUDE_100K

Limitations
-----------

-  The linkage process has order n^2 time complexity - although algorithms exist to
   significantly speed this up. Several possible speedups are described
   in http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/P4Join-BTW2015.pdf
-  The C++ code makes an assumption of 1024 bit keys (although this would be easy
   to change).
